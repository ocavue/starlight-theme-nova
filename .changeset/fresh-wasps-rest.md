'starlight-theme-nova': minor
---

`starlight-theme-nova` now detects if [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used in your project and will use it for styling when available. This enhancement will help reduce the bundle size by reusing Tailwind CSS classes if you're already using Tailwind CSS.

Please note that Tailwind CSS is optional. You can still use `starlight-theme-nova` if you don't want to use Tailwind CSS.
